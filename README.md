# Example Tutorials

Here are some sample tutorials that I have written. The topics that I've written here are more like written down consolidations of instructions and understand of the concepts that I've written on a bunch of sticky notes and random pages of my notebook. 

This is just a way of trying to remember what I figure out before, so I don't need to re-figure out how to do this again next time.

## Tutorials List

* [Using Git in Google Drive](Google-drive-git/google_drive_git_tutorial.md)

I created this tutorial because I wanted to utilize Colaboratory notebooks to do some of my analysis. The currrent GitHub integration that Google Colaboratory has is limited to only uploading copies of the notebooks themselves to GitHub. It doesn't allow commiting data files or pickle files along with the notebook.

* [How to use SSH with GitHub](ssh_tutorial/ssh_tutorial.md)

I was curious how the to use the SSH URL that's listed with GitHub repositories rather than HTTPs. It's a collection of my current understanding of SSH along with instruction written I've collected from different internet pages and videos and consolidated them together.
